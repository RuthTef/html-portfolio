<h3>In the Key of Life - Stevie Wonder </h3>
    <p1>This is my favorite album of all time! As is my favorite song of all time for sure.</p1>
<h3>The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill </h3>
    <p1>There are so many good songs off this album. The mixing of afrosoul with hip hop and rap is amazing.</p1>
<h3>To Pimp a Butterfly - K Dot </h3>
    <p1>This was such a raw interspective of being black and poor in America. And the deconstruction process was amazing.</p1>
